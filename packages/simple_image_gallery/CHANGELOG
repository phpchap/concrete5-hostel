1.1.3 - Prevent javascript conflicts in Concrete5.6+ when more than one addon/theme uses the fancybox effect (e.g. Slate Theme, Sortable Fancybox Gallery, Deluxe Image Gallery); File Manager no longer offers the useless option to "choose" images when you go there from the block edit dialog.
1.1.2 - Fixed "Divide By Zero" errors in Concrete 5.4.2 (thumbnail width/height controls were always disabled in the edit form)
1.01 - Removed duplicate "border" attribute from image output
1.0 - Initial Release
